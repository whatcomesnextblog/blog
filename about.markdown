This blog is, perhaps obviously, targeted toward those wondering what comes next. The three of us graduated with engineering degrees in May, 2019, but have a degree of disillusionment with the life we've been working toward for five years. This blog is what we would have wanted to tell ourselves about what to expect for, how to transition into, and how to best usher in What Comes Next.

For now, "what comes next" is mainly referring to post-college life, the so-called "real-world".
